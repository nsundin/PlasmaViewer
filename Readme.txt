Plasma Viewer is a tool to view PRPs or whole ages.
-------------------------------------------------
To compile it you need SDL and PlasmaLib.

It is currently mainly being developed on VisualC9 so you may need to do some editing to make it compile under Linux (although efforts are being made by me to keep it Linux-friendly).


The lead developer is Lontahv

The other devs are... a few other people.

Paradox is in charge of the Linux side of things (aka whipping me if I #include <windows.h> ;) ).

The other devs on the project are free to alter any aspect of this readme.

Negative idecate things I should have done.

-1) Hmm... -1 is not a valid indice... let's forget what I should be doing. ;P
0) Attempt to figure out what the **** is up with the mipmaps.
1) console
2) console: link and pagein/pageout commands, warp, and some other things
3) Make global pages page in first with the bar being grey rather than green.
4) ODE physics (for regions etc)?
5) Set avatar model be be player (maybe start with custom avatars since they use spans)

Performance--is timeless and thus orderless) VisRegions, not every-object-per-frame sorting.

n) Some transformational anims/anim framework.

n) Plasma engine Python API simulation and empty Python functions to avoid erroring without having to turn my engine into a copy of Plasma (skim what you need most out of the paks).

n) Sounds (OpenAL).
